# Component Based UI

## Lab Requirements

- In phase 3, we will be connecting RESTy to live APIs, fetching and displaying remote data. Our primary focus will be to service GET requests

  - As a user, I want to enter the URL to an API and issue a GET request so that I can retrieve it’s data
  - As a user, I want to see the results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format

### Application Flow:

  - User enters an API URL
  - Chooses a REST Method
  - Clicks the “Go” button
  - Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified
  - Displays the response headers and results separately
  - Both headers and results should be “pretty printed” JSON
